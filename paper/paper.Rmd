# Summary

Graphical displays can reveal problems in a statistical model that might not
be apparent from purely numerical summaries. Such visualizations can also be
helpful for the reader to evaluate validity of a model if the said analysis is
reported in a scholarly publication/report. But given the onerous cost of
preparing information-rich graphics and exploring several statistical
approaches/tests available, researchers can avoid this practice. The
`ggstatsplot` package in R programming language [@base2021] provides a one-line
syntax to create densely informative `ggplot2`-based visualizations with the
results from statistical analysis embedded in the visualization itself. In doing
so, the package helps researchers adopt a **rigorous, reliable, and robust**
data exploratory and reporting workflow.

# Statement of Need

<!-- Recent meta-research has revealed a number of problems plaguing the credibility -->
<!-- of scientific research (e.g., @chambers2019seven): findings are not replicable, -->
<!-- codes are computationally irreproducible, the statistical reporting is -->
<!-- inaccurate, the effects do not survive further robustness checks, etc. A *few* -->
<!-- of these problems can be alleviated simply by adopting good practices while -->
<!-- exploring (analyzing and visualizing) data and reporting results from -->
<!-- statistical analysis. This is where `ggstatsplot` comes in. -->

In a typical data analysis workflow, data visualization and statistical modeling
are two different phases: visualization informs modeling, and modeling in its
turn can suggest a different visualization method, and so on and so forth
[@wickham2016r]. The central idea of `ggstatsplot` is simple: combine these two
phases into one in the form of an informative graphic with statistical details.

Before discussing benefits of this approach, we will see one example (Figure 1).

```{r penguins, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Example plot from the `ggstatsplot` package illustrates its philosophy of juxtaposing informative visualizations with details from statistical analysis. To see all supported plots and statistical analyses, see the package website: https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/"}
library(ggstatsplot)
library(palmerpenguins) # for 'penguins' dataset

ggbetweenstats(penguins, species, body_mass_g)
```

As can be seen, with a **single** line of code, the function produces details
about descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, effect size estimate and
its uncertainty, pairwise comparisons, Bayesian hypothesis testing, Bayesian
posterior estimate and its uncertainty. Moreover, these details are juxtaposed
with informative and well-labeled visualizations, designed to follow best
practices in **both** data visualization [@cleveland1985; @grant2018data;
@healy2018data; @tufte2001; @wilke2019fundamentals] and (Frequentist/Bayesian)
statistical reporting [@apa2019; @van2020jasp]. Without `ggstatsplot`, getting
these statistical details and customizing a plot would require significant
amount of time and work. In other words, this package takes away *an* excuse
from researchers to thoroughly explore their data and instills good data
sanitation/exploration habits.

Internally, data cleaning is carried out using `tidyverse` [@Wickham2019], while
statistical analysis is carried out via `statsExpressions` [@Patil2021] and
`easystats` [@Ben-Shachar2020; @Lüdecke2020parameters;
@Lüdecke2020performance; @Lüdecke2019; @Makowski2019; @Makowski2020] packages.
All visualizations are constructed using the grammar of graphics framework
[@Wilkinson2012], as implemented in the `ggplot2` package [@Wickham2016].

# Benefits

In summary, the benefits of `ggstatsplot`'s approach are the following. It-

a. produces charts displaying both raw data, and numerical plus graphical
   summary indices,

b. avoids errors in statistical reporting,

c. highlights the importance of the effect by providing effect size measures by
   default,

d. provides an easy way to evaluate *absence* of an effect using a Bayesian
   framework,

e. encourages researchers/readers to evaluate statistical assumptions of a model
   in the context of the underlying data (Figure 2), and

f. is easy and simple enough that somebody with little-to-no coding experience
   can use it without making an error.

```{r reporting, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Comparing the 'Standard' approach of reporting statistical analysis in a publication/report with the 'ggstatsplot' approach of reporting the same analysis next to an informative graphic. Note that the results described in the 'Standard' approach are about the 'Dinosaur' dataset plotted on the right. Without the accompanying visualization, it is hard to evaluate the validity of the results. The ideal reporting practice will be a hybrid of these two approaches where the plot contains both the visual and numerical summaries about a statistical model, while the narrative provides interpretive context for the reported statistics."}

# Future Scope

This package is an ambitious, ongoing, and long-term project. It currently
supports common statistical tests (parametric, non-parametric, robust, or
Bayesian *t*-test, one-way ANOVA, contingency table analysis, correlation
analysis, meta-analysis, regression analyses, etc.) and corresponding
visualizations (box/violin plot, scatter plot, dot-and-whisker plot, pie chart,
bar chart, etc.). It will continue expanding to support ever increasing
collection of statistical analyses and visualizations.
